# App screen map r1 (13 Nov 26)

Status: phase 4, step 1 (PFM 25A, 13 Nov): every screen, who sees it, what it does, where its text comes from. Items marked **REC:** are open until the PFM approves. Approved 13 Nov (26A-29A). No clickable previews (PFM, 13 Nov). Colors stay provisional until go.md Task 12.

## 1. Rules for every screen

- One screen = one task (docs/guidance/customer-steps.md). Step screens show "Step X of Y", the due date, the heading, the instructions, "Why", and one main button.
- Instructional text comes from the PFM Guidance list by Guidance Key (12A); a missing key shows "Guidance missing, contact the PFM". 76 keys today.
- Names, dates, times and words follow docs/style-standard.md (DAFMAN terms, Title Case names, 13 Nov 26, 1708).
- Who sees what is decided from data, never from a list of names in the app (4A): PFM Office group membership; AO 1/2 Email on PFM Publications; Endorser on PFM Endorsements; CSS and leader rows on PFM Offices; certifier and approver fields on the action.
- Release gate: Power Apps Accessibility Checker 0 errors; text contrast 4.5:1, large text and controls 3:1 (WCAG AA).
