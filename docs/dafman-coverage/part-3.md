## Gaps

Gap and Partial rows, plus Renderer rows marked "Renderer gap". Severity: high = blocks a correct ANG wing publication or form action; medium = a required step or record not tracked; low = advisory or rare. No row is high: every high-impact rule in this range (coordination order, legal last, nonconcur gate, certify/approve, 365-day re-coordination, GM limits, rescind, review timers) has a plan location. Rows the PFM already left out by decision (DECISIONS.md:42, row 5: printed products, FPL custodians, AC history, classified products) are marked "PFM-excluded".
