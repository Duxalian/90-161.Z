# Format and writing rules: 90-161.Z

Source: DAFMAN 90-161, 18 Oct 2023, Change 1 (14 Jul 2025), Corrective Action (1 May 2026).
Extraction status: **verified 2026-11-10** against the literal text (self-review, not independent review). Literal text: ref/dafman90-161.txt (from ref/dafman90-161.pdf, 199 pages). Rows with a date in `Verified` were checked against that text. Before any rule is used as a hard check, verify its wording against the PDF and set `Verified` to the date.

Goal (PFM, 2026-11-10): the rules force output to look like DAFMAN 90-161 itself. AFIMPT is not used for formatting or tracking.

Context (PFM, 2026-11-10): ANG wing. ANG wing publications are not processed by AFDPO (1.1.3.2, 6.6.3), so the renderer's `final` mode must produce the camera-ready publication, including the TOC (F-027) and manual margin bars for ICs (4.5.6 note).

## How the rules are enforced

| Layer | Mechanism | What it guarantees |
|---|---|---|
| L1 Schema | The model returns content only as structured JSON (header fields, paragraphs with level, tables, attachments). The schema has no font, size or style fields. | The model cannot change format. |
| L2 Renderer | Deterministic code builds the .docx from the JSON. Fonts, margins, numbering, bolding and header block are fixed in code. | Same input gives the same layout every time. |
| L3 Validator | Code checks each rule below and reports pass/fail per rule ID. | "Perfect" = 0 fails on `hard` rules. |

Check type: `schema` = enforced by L1; `render` = enforced by L2; `lint` = checked by L3 on the text; `human` = PFM checks.
Severity: `hard` = blocks output; `warn` = reported only.

| F-039 | Compliance statements use "will"/"must", name a responsible party, end with bold tier "(T-1)"; no blanket tiers. In a wing or delta publication the validator does not ask for a tier (PFM 2B, 2026-11-12; see F-040) | 4.6.5 | lint | warn | 2026-11-10 |
| F-040 | Do not use a tier number at the issuer's own level: in a wing or delta publication, (T-3) is redundant because the wing or delta/CC who approved it is the default waiver authority. The validator treats a publication as wing level when `byOrderOf` is COMMANDER and `issuerLine` or `byOrderOfUnit` names a WING or DELTA (a keyword guess: the schema has no level field, so an abbreviated issuer such as WG is missed and a non-wing name with WING or DELTA is caught). A wing or delta compliance statement carries no tier, except (T-0), (T-1) or (T-2) where the waiver authority is above the wing (PFM 2B, 2026-11-12). Severity warn (PFM 1A, 2026-11-12) | Attachment 10 note 4; 4.6.5.3.2 | lint | warn | 2026-11-12 |
| W-001 | Use "must", not "shall" | T1.1 #5 | lint | hard | 2026-11-10 |
| W-002 | Sentences 20 words or fewer; paragraphs 7 sentences or fewer | T1.1 #2 | lint | warn | 2026-11-10 |
| W-003 | No all-caps for emphasis | T1.1 #4 | lint | warn | 2026-11-10 |
| W-004 | Active voice; plain language | T1.1 #1, 1.2.2 | lint | warn | 2026-11-10 |
| X-001 | No unresolved [[PFM: ...]] placeholder from the extraction prompt (prompts/90161Z-T06-extract-prompt-r2.txt); never invent a value (AGENTS.md) | - | lint | hard | 2026-11-11 |
| S-001 | File names without spaces (3.8.2). The rest of 3.8 (left flush template, separate figure files) is for e-Publishing submission and does not apply to ANG wing camera-ready posting | 3.8 | render | hard | 2026-11-10 |
